## todo/ideas

- neater way of updating lanes - a lot of boilerplate?
  - SetLength - need to handle each lane in diff ways
  - SetLaneValue - again - same old thing
- lane for length
- lane for velocity
- lane for playback chance
- sync changes to beat (toggle?)
- randomise lanes/all?
- limit to scale
- bpm/playback speed adjuster
- swing
- resync lanes button
